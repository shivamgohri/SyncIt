# SyncIt

This project was made to remove the ```middle-man eg Class-CR``` between the teachers and the students for the smooth communication. It has features like ```Time-table Sync``` and ```Polling``` by which teachers can directly manage their class and can update students regarding the ```status of the lecture``` like if it's postponed, on-time, cancelled.

## Demo

```coming soon```
